NSGs
-MGT NSG can be updated to restrict source of inbound traffic--increases security

BitLocker on All VMs require a restart - not configured correctly
-Possibly related to the frozen startbar/taskbar on all VMs

AZ-BDC-VM is not domain-joined, and not functioning as a full backup DC

AZ-PDC-VM - no AD Tools installed, except for PoSh module. Can be remotely managed. Intended to limit attack surface?

Do we want bastion host as domain-joined?

None of the availability sets are managed (using unmanaged disks--can result in single points of failure)--is this on the end user to configure?
-Fault domains and update domains - more than is necessary for the deployment. Leave as is?

DNS--only set on the primary DC

Environment is Azure AD capable--on end user to configure?

Keyvault - does not contain BackupFairFax policy - for end user to configure?
	-Contains 8 keys (listed as containing 7 secrets--contains more than 7 secrets)
	-if customer uses their own cert--recommend using managed key for the cert in AKV - add language?
	




Things to try:
Address Name resolution issues--possibly will fix encryption problems

schedule restarts for all VMs at the very end - active bitlocker

Remove BitLocker from the template--initiate BitLocker through the script



Bugs

AzureDiskEncryption:
Unable to read data from the transport connection: A connection attempt failed
because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because
connected host has failed to respond.
